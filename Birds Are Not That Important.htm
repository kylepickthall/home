                <h2>Preface</h2>
                <p>Hello, my friends.</p>
				<p>It has recently come to my attention that some very destructive 
and hurtful behaviour has started to spread across deviantART, tumblr, 
and other image sharing sites. In fact, I have seen this also on other 
sites like Facebook and Reddit. But the most intrusive offenders usually
 flock from Twitter.</p>
				<p>As we all know, inappropriate behaviour on the internet can cause
 SERIOUS implications for people on the receiving end of these offences.
 Often, people will feel stressed or uncomfortable when faced with 
offensive content like this. In the worst cases, some people may be 
emotionally triggered or deterred from visiting their most frequented 
websites. It’s hard to quantify the emotional costs that accompany daily
 harassment both for them and those bystanders who support this cause.</p>
				<p>Every time someone posts anything online, there is a chance of this topic raising its' ugly head.</p>
				<p>What is this problem, you may wonder?</p>
				<p>Some people have incorrectly come to the conclusion that "birds are important". THIS IS NOT TRUE.</p>
				<p>Many people disagree on how important birds are. Some say that 
they are very important, while others disagree, and hold that birds are 
not that important. Due to this being an important subject, this topic 
should be carefully considered until a truthful conclusion is reached.</p>
				<p>If birds suddenly disappeared from the earth, there would be 
problems, but life would go on. There are many much more important 
things than birds. Generally, other animals have better traits in all 
physical stats and are generally smarter than birds. People are more 
important. Words are definitely more important. Food to eat, a place to 
live, and clothes to keep warm are much more important. Having good 
relationships with people and earning what you want in life are more 
important as well. Love is more important. In the scheme of life, birds 
are not that important. This is because everything that exists is 
important in some way, and many things are vastly more important than 
birds.</p>
				<p>BIRDS ARE NOT THAT IMPORTANT.</p>
				<p>The statement that "birds are important" is simply incorrect and 
shows that the person who has uttered this has not learned enough about 
birds and their unimportance.</p>
				<p>The notion that a type of bird is more important than anything 
else, or important at all, is simply the product of ignorance. When 
someone says birds are not important, you have to remember that not 
everyone has received the same bird education, and some people don't 
even understand the lack of importance birds have. Birds have no 
motives. No emotions. No life goals. Birds are a negative impact on 
every life they effect.</p>

                    <h2>The Movement</h2>
                    <p>The movement to increase the awareness about the 
fact that birds are not important is rapidly growing. We have banded 
together under the banner of:</p>
					<p>B.A.N.T.I<br>(Birds Are Not That Important)</p>
					<p>The most important goal of B.A.N.T.I. is to raise awareness of 
the unimportance of birds, and to help people avoid contact with birds 
and their unimportance.</p>
					<p>I am heavily warning you that you should avoid contact with ALL 
birds at any cost. All birds are equally not that important, and you 
should not interact, view, or listen to any type of bird. This includes 
(but is not limited to):</p>

                <h2>In Case Of Birds</h2>
					<p>The number one thing to remember during or directly after viewing a bird is DO NOT PANIC.</p>
					<p>Should you accidentally view an unimportant bird picture, calmly
 remind yourself that "birds are not that important". If this is not 
enough, you may simply scroll UP or DOWN off the webpage, close your 
laptop, or manually power off your computer using the power button 
located on your machine. The number of bird sightings on social media 
sites and on the internet in general are drastically increasing, and it 
is important that you remember these steps should an emergency occur.</p>
					<p>At all costs, you must AVOID places that talk or promote the importance of birds, like these sites: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Important_Bird_Area">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Important_Bird_Area</a> (do not click)</p>

					<h2>Your Part</h2>
						<p>It is important to spread the word about the unimportance of 
birds to anyone you care about to help keep them safe. Please keep any 
one of these images on file in the event that you should ever spot a 
bird, and be prepared to post it to warn any other passerby's about 
birds.</p>
